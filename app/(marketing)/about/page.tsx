        <h1 className="mt-2 font-serif text-4xl">A companion on the flight home.</h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          Every year, hundreds of thousands of first-generation immigrant families want to bring a
          parent over from India, China, the Philippines, Nigeria. The blocker is rarely the visa or
          the ticket. It&apos;s the flight itself.

      <section className="mt-8 space-y-4">
        <p>
          Most parents don&apos;t speak English, have never seen a self-service kiosk, can&apos;t
          read the boarding signage, and panic at connecting flights. Today the workaround lives in
          WhatsApp groups and Facebook posts:{' '}
          <em>&ldquo;Anyone flying CCU → AMS via DOH on the 14th? My mother needs help.&rdquo;</em>
        </p>
        <p>That&apos;s the entire product. Make that post a structured search.</p>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          Saathi makes the introduction between two people who would have met on WhatsApp anyway.
          Money moves between them directly — Revolut, UPI, cash at the gate, whatever they prefer.
          We don&apos;t touch it. That keeps us out of payments licensing, out of disputes, and lets
          us ship.

      <section className="mt-10 space-y-3">
        <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl">What we are not</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          Saathi isn&apos;t meet-and-assist-as-a-service. Professional airport assistance exists —
          Schiphol charges €80–120 for it. Saathi is cheaper, but more importantly it&apos;s
          cultural: someone who speaks your mother&apos;s language is worth more than a uniformed
          assistant who doesn&apos;t.
