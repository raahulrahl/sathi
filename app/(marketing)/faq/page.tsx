        q: 'What is Saathi, in one sentence?',
        a: 'A free introduction service that matches families sending an elderly loved one on a flight with travellers already on that flight who can keep them company through security, transfers, and arrival.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Who is Saathi for?',
        a: 'Anyone sending an older relative — parent, spouse, sibling, in-law, friend — on an international flight they might find overwhelming, and anyone already flying who would gladly help someone on their plane.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Is it free to sign up?',
        a: 'Yes. No subscription, no per-trip fee. Saathi makes no money from the match itself — we may add optional paid features in the future but the core introduction is and will stay free.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Which routes are supported?',
        a: 'Any route with two or more IATA airport codes. Launch focus is India ↔ Netherlands and India ↔ Germany, with common layovers at Doha, Dubai, Istanbul, Frankfurt.',

        q: 'How does Saathi pair me with someone?',
        a: "You post either a request (I need a companion for this flight) or an offer (I'm on this flight and willing to help). Matches happen on three criteria, in order: shared language, exact flight number, and close date. Flight number is the strongest signal — same route on different planes isn't really a match.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I pick who helps my loved one?',
        a: 'Yes. When someone sends you a request, you see their verified profile, languages, and short intro message. You accept whoever feels right. Declining costs nothing.',

            Share your request page with your community — a WhatsApp group, a Facebook post, a

      },
      {
        q: "I don't know the flight number yet — can I still post?",
        a: 'Yes, but the match quality drops. Without a flight number we can only show people on the same route within a few days of your date, not people on the same plane. Add the flight number as soon as the ticket is booked — it only takes a second to edit.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can my loved one travel with multiple companions (e.g. different legs)?',

    title: 'Trust & safety',
    entries: [
      {
        q: 'How do you verify users?',
        a: 'Social-graph based, not passport scans. Every user connects at least two of LinkedIn, X, or WhatsApp before they can post or send a request. Fakeable alone, hard to fake together. Verified channels appear as badges on each profile.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What does the other person see before I accept?',

      },
      {
        q: "I don't feel comfortable with a match — what do I do?",
        a: 'Decline. You never owe a reason. If you want to go further, every profile and every chat has a report button; reported accounts land in a human review queue and can be suspended.',
      },
      {
        q: "Is my loved one's information safe?",
        a: "Yes. Names, photos, and medical notes stay on our servers encrypted at rest and are only shown to a companion after you've explicitly accepted their request. Other users, anonymous visitors, and search engines never see any of it.",

        a: (
          <>
            No — we can&rsquo;t. Saathi is an introduction service, not an airport concierge. If a
            companion no-shows, cancel the match and their profile badges drop. See our{' '}

    entries: [
      {
        q: 'Can I post for multiple loved ones travelling together?',
        a: 'Yes. On the request form, add as many people as are travelling — a couple, siblings, a parent and an in-law. Each gets their own name, age band, and medical notes. The companion sees all of them after accepting.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I post more than one trip?',
        a: 'Yes, as many as you like. Each trip is separate. Your dashboard lists all of them.',
      },
      {
        q: "What if my loved one doesn't have a smartphone?",
        a: "That's the normal case, not an exception. Saathi is designed around you — the family member — doing the posting and matching. The companion and you coordinate directly on WhatsApp, and you brief your loved one in person.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I also offer to help someone while travelling myself?',
        a: 'Yes. Post an offer for any leg you\'re already flying. You\'ll see requests on that route show up as "Hoping to join" on your dashboard.',

      {
        q: 'I accidentally posted the wrong route or date — can I edit?',

    title: 'Day of travel',
    entries: [
      {
        q: 'How do we find each other at the airport?',
        a: 'Once a request is accepted, contact details unlock. Exchange WhatsApp messages the day before — a short intro with a photo makes the meet-up easier. Most pairs agree a meeting spot at check-in, typically 2–3 hours before departure.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What if the flight is delayed or cancelled?',
        a: "Coordinate directly — you already have each other's contact. If the flight is cancelled entirely, the match carries over to the rebooked flight if both of you are on it; otherwise it gets cancelled and you can post a new trip.",
      },
      {
        q: "I can't do the trip anymore — how do I cancel?",
        a: "Cancel the match from your dashboard. If you're a family member, post a new request. If you're a companion, your profile takes a small hit for late cancellation but it isn't a permanent mark — we weight it lightly and it fades after a couple of completed trips.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What do I actually do as a companion?',
        a: "Usually: help with check-in, immigration forms, finding the right gate after a connection, and keeping an eye out during the journey. It's companionship, not medical care. Specific help categories the family needs are listed on the trip page.",
      },

    title: 'Thank-you & payments',
    entries: [
      {
        q: 'Does Saathi take a cut of the thank-you?',
        a: 'No. Money moves directly between the family and the companion in whatever currency and app they prefer — Revolut, UPI, cash at the gate. Saathi never sees it.',
      },
      {
        q: "What's a reasonable thank-you amount?",
        a: "We suggest €15–25 for most routes — a small gesture, not a fee. It\'s optional, and often covered by buying the companion a coffee or paying for their airport parking. Families set the amount on the request form; companions can take it or leave it.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Should I pay before or after the flight?',
        a: "After. Keeping payment off-platform and post-flight aligns the companion's incentives with actually showing up and being helpful, without Saathi having to play escrow.",
      },
      {
        q: 'How is this different from airport meet-and-assist services?',
        a: "Airport paid services cost €80–120, are uniformed, and rarely speak your loved one's language. Saathi is cheaper and picks someone who actually shares a mother tongue and cultural context.",

    title: 'Account & privacy',
    entries: [
      {
        q: 'Can the same person be both a family member and a companion?',

      },
      {
        q: 'What data does Saathi collect?',
        a: "Only what you enter: name, role, languages, linked social accounts, trips, and match messages. We don't track your location, don't sell data, and don't run third-party ads. Analytics are first-party (Vercel, PostHog for feature flags) and gated behind cookie consent.",
